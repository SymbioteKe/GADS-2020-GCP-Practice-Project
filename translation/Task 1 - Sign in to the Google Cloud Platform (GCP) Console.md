# Task 1: Sign in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console

This is referenced to by the *translated* projects as Task 1. This is to be performed to initialize the Lab.

For each lab, you get a new GCP project and set of resources for a fixed time at no cost.

1. Make sure you signed into Qwiklabs using an **incognito window**.

2. Note the lab's access time (for example,![alt text](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/aZQJ4BT7uCmM9XR6BTXgTRP1Hfu1T7q6V%2BcnbdEsbpU%3D)and make sure you can finish in that time block.

   There is no pause feature. You can restart if needed, but you have to start at the beginning.

3. When ready, click ![alt text](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/XE8x7uvQokyubNwnYKKc%2BvBBNrMlo5iNZiDDzQQ3Ddo%3D)

4. Note your lab credentials. You will use them to sign in to Cloud Platform Console.![alt text](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/0d78dhX6IVMVWmixCPPSBbmi5O2GPokCXf1Ps1AkTgI%3D)

5. Click **Open Google Console**.

6. Click **Use another account** and copy/paste credentials for **this** lab into the prompts.

   If you use other credentials, you'll get errors or **incur charges**.

7. Accept the terms and skip the recovery resource page.  

Do not click **End Lab** unless you are finished with the lab or want to restart it. This clears your work and removes the project.
